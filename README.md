#  Pouriya Tajmehrabi!

I'm a graduate IST student at York University researching data management solutions. I obtained my BSc in Computer Engineering from University of Tehran with a minor in software engineering. I have experience working as a high frequency trading software engineer, later in my career I switched to quantitative machine learning and data engineering. I have built extensive ml platforms for financial machine learning applications. My interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and big data, I am generally interested in how software engineer/machine learning solutions evolve in the face of large scale data operations. I have utilized various third party technologies to I have dealt with massive datasets to utilize them in machine learning, statistical inference and financial applications, these technologies include Apache Spark, ClickHouse, Ray. TimeScaleDB,. My responsibilites included training models, fine-tuning hyper parameters and designing backtesting/evaluation mechanisms for trading and market making strategies.
I have used my bachelor years to explore various areas of Computer Science academically too. In my research journey I have worked on blockchain platforms and I have also worked on survival analysis through machine learning.
